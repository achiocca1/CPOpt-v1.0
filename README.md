# CPOpt

Automatic calculation of critical plane damage parameters by the optimized method presented in the paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020740322008529, based on tensors analysis and Mohr's representation; the stress and strain tensor obtained at each load step of a finite element analysis are employed

- CPOpt_v1.0 (it includes *Fatemi-Socie*  and *Smith-Watson-Topper* critical plane factors)

The mathematical procedure is described in the article:

**A. Chiocca, F. Frendo, G. Marulo, "An efficient algorithm for critical plane factors evaluation", International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Volume 242, 2023, 10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107974.**
